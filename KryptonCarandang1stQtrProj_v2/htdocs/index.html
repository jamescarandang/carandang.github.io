			This webpage is called the Ice Shop. In the Ice Shop, you are able to buy a variety of ice, like regular ice, dried ice, and icebergs. Our ice originates from the very
			best places to make ice, like Mt. Everest, Antarctica, and outer space. As we have space stations, we are able to deliver ice all over the world, and our ice is always
			solid and ice-cold.
